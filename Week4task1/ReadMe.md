- Control plane -> manages the state of the cluster , making global decisions and responding events. It consists of several
key components:
	- kube-apiserver -> exposes the Kubernetes API and serves as the front end for the control plane
	- etcd -> Key value stored for all cluster data
	- kube-scheduler -> assigns pods to nodes
	- kube-controller-manager -> runs controllers that handle routine tasks

- Nodes are the working machines in the cluster
	- kubelet -> agent that ensures container are running
	- container runtime -> manages the execution and lifecycle of the containers.
	- kube-proxy -> implements networks rulls to allow comunitation to and from Pods.
- Addons
	- Dns-> Provides DNS servers for Kubernetes apps
	- Web UI -> web-based interface for managing and troubleshooting the cluster
	- container resource monitoring -> Tracks container metrics and provides UI for visualization
	- Cluster-level-logging -> stores logs from all containers in the cluster
- Deployment variations
	- Traditional Deployment -> Components are run directly on dedicated machines or virtual machines.
	- static pods
	- self-hosted -> Control plane components run as Pods within the cluster
	- managed kubernetes services
